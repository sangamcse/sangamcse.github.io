## What’s GSoC ?

GSoC is an annual program administered and funded by Google for students all
around the world to contribute to open source software in summer. You may
think that only undergrads are allowed to take part in this program, but
that’s not the case. Undergrads, students in graduate programs, PhD candidates
can take part in GSoC. As computer science or software engineering students
GSoC one of the most prestigious things that students can accomplish.

## Why open source ?

Open source software is the heart and soul of many organizations. It would be
real hard to imagine more secure and reliable software without open source
initiatives. Everyday hundreds and thousands of developers contribute to
different open source software. Just to get an idea about how OSS contributes
for entire software development industry, here’s a look at the statistics on
different project on GitHub in 2017.

back at the projects, people, and teams of 2017.

GSoC is based on a model of different organizations providing projects for
students all around the world. Each organization assign mentors for every
project and students are paired with mentors once they get selected.

I’m happy that I have been selected to work with [coala](https://coala.io) for
[GSoC 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## About coala

[coala](https://coala.io) is a free and open-source language independent code
analysis tool, written in Python. The primary goal of coala is to make it
easier for developers to create [rules and standards](https://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Users/coafile.html)
to be followed in the source code.

coala provides a unified command-line interface for linting and fixing all
your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. coala allows you
to simply check your code against certain quality requirements. The checking
routines are named Bears in coala. You can easily define a simple project file
to check your project with all bears either shipped with coala or ones you
found in the internet and trust.

You can use coala from within your favorite editor, integrate it with your CI,
get the results as JSON, or customize it to your needs with its flexible
configuration syntax.

## What more ?

This is my first blog post about GSoC, many more will follow. Here I will post
about the progress of my project along with some random posts about life or
some tech tutorial. There are two reasons why I have started this blog. First
I have been selected in GSoC and the program require writing blog. Secondly,
I follow lots of blogs on various topics on Quora/Medium etc regularly so I
always thought about writing a blog but never started one. So after my
selection in GSoC, I started blogging with this one.

It is going to be a challenging task for sure. Hoping to have lots of fun and
looking forward to learning many new things this summer with coala and plan to
use this blog to post updates and developments. Feel free to contact me for
any queries/questions regarding GSoC and I’ll be more than happy to answer
them.

Thats all folks ! Stay tuned.
